Welcome to Bloc Pong!  Bloc Pong is a replica of the classic arcade game, Pong.  Bloc Pong was built using the HTML Canvas functionality.  

As you likely know, the objective of Bloc Pong is to outscore the computer.  The rules are simple.  The first player to 11 points win the game.  Here's a deeper look at the steps taken to create replica of pong.  

Create Visuals
In this task, I created a number of elements including the table, paddles, and ball

Control the Paddle, Animate the Ball, Create the Computer AI
In these tasks, I wrote code to both move and control the paddle, I put the ball into motion and ensured that it would collide with the sides of the canvas, and I animated the computerâ€™s paddle and also wrote code to serve the ball once either player had scored.

End the Game
In this task, I capped the score so that either the player or computer would win once the their score reached 11 points.  Once 11 points are reached by either user, the game ends.  The user will need to refresh the browser to play again.
